# Controllable-Image-Synthesis-With-Attribute-Decomposed-GAN
This project implements Attribute-Decomposed Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN++) for controllable image synthesis. The model enables precise manipulation of visual attributes while maintaining high image quality by learning and separating attribute representations during training.
